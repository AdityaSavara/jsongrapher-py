#First, we create a new JSONGrapherRecord that we'll put the equation into.
#It's a good practice to set our datatype, graph title, and axes titles directly after making a graph object.
Record = JSONRecordCreator.create_new_JSONGrapherRecord()

### Let's add an equation_dict ###

#We'll define an equation, with parameters using the equation_dict format that json_equationer uses.
#The later variables define the default range and points resolution of the curve.
#Here, we are using a python dictionary. Python dictionaries are slightly different than JSON. With a json string, one would have to use json.loads()

    "equation_string": "k = A*(e**((-Ea)/(R*T)))",
    "x_variable": "T (K)",  
    "y_variable": "k (s**(-1))",
    "constants": {"Ea": "30000 (J)*(mol^(-1))", "R": "8.314 (J)*(mol^(-1))*(K^(-1))" , "A": "1*10^13 (s^-1)", "e": "2.71828"},
    "num_of_points": 10,
    "x_range_default": [200, 500],
    "x_range_limits" : [],
    "x_points_specified" : [],
    "points_spacing": "Linear",
    "reverse_scaling" : False
}

#Now we can add this equation record as a dataseries into the JSONGrapher record. 
# By default, the equation will be evaluated when added, and also when plotted.
Record.add_data_series_as_equation(series_name="Arrhenius Example 1", graphical_dimensionality=2, equation_dict=equation_dict, trace_style = "spline")

### Now, let's add an equation using json_equationer ###

#one can use import json_equationer.equation_creator, but it is also packaged with JSONGrapher for convenience.
import JSONGrapher.equation_creator as equation_creator

# Add constants one at a time, or through a list. We'll use a different Ea for this one.
second_Arrhenius_equation.add_constants({"Ea": "40000 J/mol"})

# Optinally, set minimum number of points and limits for calculations.

#Use the equation dictionary to add the second data series, then plot
