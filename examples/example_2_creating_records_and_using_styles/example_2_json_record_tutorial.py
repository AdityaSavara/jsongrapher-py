#The built in function is recommended as it first does automatic consistency updates and validation checks before printing.

#Record.add_data_series(series_name = "pear tree growth", x_values=time_in_years, y_values=tree_heights, plot_type = "spline")
#Record.add_data_series(series_name = "pear tree growth", x_values=time_in_years, y_values=tree_heights, plot_type = "scatter")


#We can also plot the data with matplotlib, and can export to file as png.

#This new copy has two datasets in it. Let's popout the second data set, which is index 1.

#now let's merge in the new record.

#Now plot the JSONGrapher object again. This time, there will be 3 series.

#Now let's try applying a predfined style!

#we can also "temporarily" apply a style while plotting, without changing the record itself..
nature_plot_style = {"layout_style":"Nature", "trace_styles_collection":"default"}
Record.plot(plot_style=nature_plot_style)
#So this plot will produce the "Science" style again:
Record.plot()
#One can also remove styles, and produce the default style, again.
Record.remove_plot_style()
Record.plot()

#Note: As of April 2025, the styles have not actually been made suitable for journals. However, the feature is here so that such styles can be made.
