Please note that all of the JSON files can be dragged into JSONGrapher.
The reason that python scripts are provided in most of these examples
is because these examples are to teach a user how to create JSONGrapher records.
Anyone can drag the records into jsongrapher (without any knowledge) after that.

Each directory has a separate example with the python file to run beginning with the word "example"

example_1_drag_and_drop shows how to launch a JSONGrapher window for dragging and dropping in multiple files for merging and plotting.

example_2_creating_records_and_using_styles provides a tutorial like example on how to make JSONGrapher records and apply styles (layout_style and trace_styles_collection)

example_3_online_simulation_call shows an example where the json record calls JavaScript source code from online to simulate and populate a dataseries.

example_4_custom_units shows an example where custom units are used.

example_5_equation_plotting shows an example where an equation with units is entered from python commands and plotted.

example_6_equation_alongside_data shows an example where equations with units are loaded from JSONGrapher records and plotted alongside datapoints.

example_7_custom_formatting_and_style_extraction shows an example of how to apply formatting as well as how to make, extract and use styles (layout_style and trace_style)

example_8_custom_formatting_advanced of how to further customize the formatting of individual traces, which can be used to make styles.

example_9_scatter3d_and_mesh3d_plots shows an example of 3D plots (both scatter3d and mesh3d, where there latter is a surface plot)

example_10_bubble_plot shows an example of how to create a bubble2d plot and also a bubble3d plot. The bubble size adds an extra dimension to the image.

example_11_local_python_call shows an example where the json record calls a local python function to simulate and populate a dataseries. This feature requires the user's script to call the feature, for security reasons. The JSON record cannot call functions "by itself".

example_12_offset_and_series2dTo3d shows an example where a series of 2d spectra are offset to or converted into a 3d image. This can also be done with timeseries, scatter, etc.
